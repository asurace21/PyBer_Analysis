# PyBer_Analysis
## **Overview**
The purpose of this analysis is to create a data frame of ride-sharing data by city type. We will use this data in our analysis to better understand how the data differs by city type and how we can use that information to make informed decisions.
## **Results**

 This image shows that rural driver's are averaging the highest fare per ride and driver, but their total fares account for less than 10% of all fares. Urban drivers have the lowest average fare per ride and per driver, but account for the highest percentage of all fares.

Our line graph also highlights the differences in driver’s weekly fares based on city type. However, with this visualization we can see how the weekly driver’s fares for the 3 different city types, trend against one another over a 4-month span. Urban drivers bring in the most weekly fares, followed by suburban, then rural drivers. The line graph also shows us that regardless of city type, all driver’s fares tend to follow the same seasonal pattern. For instance, at the end of February all driver’s fares spike, indicating that it is a busy time to travel. 
## **Summary**
The first business recommendation would be to put a hard cap on the number of drivers allowed to operate in the rural area. There are less rides and therefore no need for more drivers. Also, this would allow for the average fare per ride and average fare per driver to increase and be on par with other city types. 
Conversely, another recommendation would be to increase the number of drivers in the urban city types. This would cause their average fare per ride and driver to decrease, but it would put them more in line with the drivers from other city types in terms of weekly fares. It would also allocate more drivers to urban city types, where there is more demand.  
The final recommendation would be to anticipate the travel spike at the end of Februrary and plan accordingly by enrolling more drivers across all city types on a temporary basis.
